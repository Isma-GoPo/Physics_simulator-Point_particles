# Roadmap
This is the roadmap of this repository. The features I want to be adding in a future.

## Simplify particle
- [ ] Make Dot to plotting class independent of the particles itselfs

## Make adaptative more adaptative
- [ ] Allow setting a percentile of velocity_diff (as position history) so when it is exceed it triggers the adpatative steps

## More functions and init spaces
- [ ] Add more functions

## Charge particle
- [ ] Add a Particle subClass with charge
  - Add electric forces functions
