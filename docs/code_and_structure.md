## Dependences
The programm would be using 
- Numpy for the numbers and calculations.
- Propper Documentation
- Git repository
- Uploading to GitHub

## Other software use
- Github


It can be understanded by three components:
- A physics and dynamic part which contains the forces functions, particles and their dynamics
- A simulation part that manage the space of particles and run the simulation step by step calculating the forces and making adaptive time steps if necessary
- An animation plotting part that takes the results of the simulation and plot an animation using the given parameters.
