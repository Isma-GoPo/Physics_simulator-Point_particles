# Roadmap
This is the roadmap of this repository. The features I want to be adding in a future.


## When in main

## Make adaptative more adaptative
- [ ] Allow setting a percentile of velocity_diff (as position history) so when it is exceed it triggers the adpatative steps
- [ ] Make an `adaptability` class
  - [ ] Make it geenral for atributes as Velocity difference, but not specific for it
  - [ ] Make it take functions for getting this atributes from the classes
- [ ] Add an specific `adaptability` config

## More functions and init spaces
- [ ] Add more functions

## Charge particle
