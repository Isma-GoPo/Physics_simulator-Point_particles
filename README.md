## Project Description
This is a Minigame Programm that show several randomized figures so the user have to count them as quickly as possible to give the result.

## Python used libraries / functions
The programm would be using 
- CustomTkinter for the minigame interface
- Numpy for the numbers and random distributions (not necessary but for learning it)
- Pandas for saving best times in games (not necessary but for learning it)
- Error Handling in the class initializing (raising Exceptions)
- Propper Documentation

## Other software use
- [Vercel v0](https://v0.dev/chat/c1Q9lJbrrt3) as a tool for going faster

## Project goals
The programm would have to possibility:
- Display a random number of objects in a window, without collaiding with each others. Then having an number input to show a score output.
- Be able to save the games in a csv.

## Development
1. I asked `Vercel v0`:
	"Generate a Python App using customtkinter. The app must have three main elements: a big display window, and a frame with an input and an a score output. The app shows several randomized simple figures (circles, squares, may be stars, etc) so the user have to count them as quickly as possible to give the result."
	- Then I pasted to see if it works
2. Understanding what it has done 
3. Commenting and editing code for making it as I would do it.
