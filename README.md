## Project Description
This is a learning physics programm that simulates the dynamics of puntual charges in a space, using Newton and gravity/Coulomb equations for calculating forces and then basic cinematic equation for tracing the trajectories.

- For reading the path to take read [Roadmap](./docs/roadmap.md)


## Python used libraries / functions
The programm would be using 
- Numpy for the numbers and calculations.
- In a future, Pandas to import first data and export the calculations from/to a .csv 
- Error Handling in the class initializing (raising Exceptions)
- Propper Documentation
- Git repository
- Uploading to GitHub

## Other software use
- Github

## Project goals
The programm would have to possibility:
- Given the initial position, velocities and the particles and masses (and charges) calculate reiteratively the new velocities and positions
- Displaying this in a graphic way.
- Be able to export the calculations to a file.

## Development
1. I have been looking at an [old repository](https://github.com/Isma-GoPo/Puntual_Charges_Physics_Simulator.git) I made a year ago.	
   But I've been slowly adding the features to make it better and smaller. The old project was more ambitious than what I could manage.
