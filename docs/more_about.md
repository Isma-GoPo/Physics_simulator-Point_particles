# More about
This document detail more about the project development and how I personally have been developing it.

## Project goals
The program would have to possibility:
- Given the initial position, velocities and the particles and masses (and charges) calculate reiteratively the new velocities and positions
- Displaying this in a graphic way.
- Be able to export the calculations to a file.

## What I have learned
- Related to Python
  - I added documentation and type hints in function and classes
  - Implemented for my first time annonymous functions and decorators
  - I learned more about numpy and data manipulation
  - I learned the basics about how to develop modules and packages in python
- Programming in general
  - I deepen my knowledge of object oriented programming
  - Getting used to Git workflow
  - Sharing to Github my first project with proper documentation and structure
  - I made my first big debugs of code

## How did I feel about the development
In the start, I have been looking at an [old repository](https://github.com/Isma-GoPo/Puntual_Charges_Physics_Simulator.git) I made a year ago. I never finished it because it was more ambitious than what I could manage. So I've been adding the features to make it better and more concise in the start. And adding features over an already functional program.
